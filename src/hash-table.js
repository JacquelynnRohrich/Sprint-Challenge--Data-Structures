// I googled for a straight hour if not longer, 
// I also looked at my linked list from last week and it didn't give me a clear picture either, 
// I barely get a grasp on what we are learning then have to relearn it the next week causing a backup in my brain.
// so this was not completed but not for a lack of effort but for being completely confused about what you want from me.
// I find these impossible to read in the first place and now the instructions are even more wonky with this one. 
// I am doing what is asked of me and instead of coping and pasting I am taking the time to tell you i am lost. 
// so I am going to spend the next twenty min plus lunch to watch videos and more videos and read on this again.
