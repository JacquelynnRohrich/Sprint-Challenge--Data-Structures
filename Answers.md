## Questions
## What are the order of insertions/removals for the following data structures? 
* Stack - First in, Last out
* Queue - First in, first out
## What is the retreival time complexity for the following data structures? 
* Linked List 
low complexity to implement
inserts are O(1)
lookups are O(N)
* Hash Table
high complexity to implement
inserts are O(1) on average
lookups are O(1) on average
* Binary Search Trees 
medium complexity to implement (assuming you can't get them from a library)
inserts are O(logN)
lookups are O(logN)
## What are some advantages to using a Hash Tables over an array in JavaScript?
* Speed.
* Efficiency.
* Reduces average lookup costs.
* No collisions.
